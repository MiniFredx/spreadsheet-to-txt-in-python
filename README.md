# spreadsheet-to-txt-in-python
Converts specific columns into readable data in a txt file, avoiding the need for a pivot table.

In the current version the spreadsheet that you want converted to a .txt MUST be named "fedex.xlsx"
which also means it must be of type .xlsx

I plan on allowing it to take user input in the future.
